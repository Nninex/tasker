# TASKER

# features : 

## user
user registration,  login, logout 

## profile
view and update profile (including uploading an image) 

## tasks
add, view and delete tasks 

## priorities
set priority (high, medium, low) and category to a task [issue: it is seen only in update-task template, not in view-tasks]

## categories
add, delete and view categories [add and delete is working, but I created some categories from admin page, so after deleting and adding new, it seems that in database last category is saved and it gives prompt "already exists"]

# front-side styling
slightly used css, mostly appearance of project is achieved with included bootswatch link.
